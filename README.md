Recipes
=======

## vsftpd::default

Installs/configures vsftpd, includes some sub-tasks via `include_recipe`. 

Known Issue
===========

When using *Ubuntu 12.04* or *Debian Wheezy* you will have issues with
this cookbook and running `chroot_local_users=YES` in the configuration.

There are some workarounds to overcome this problem:

* [Blake's Coding Blog](http://blakecode.blogspot.de/2012/08/vsftpd-refusing-to-run-with-writable.html)
* [Ubuntu 12.04 Fix](http://blog.thefrontiergroup.com.au/2012/10/making-vsftpd-with-chrooted-users-work-again/)

The basic gist of these articles:

* revoke write permissions on the users home 
* setup a different chroot environment via `passwd_chroot_enable=YES`
* install a patched version of the vsftpd 2.x branch and set
  `allow_writeable_chroot=YES` to ignore this error
* use vsftpd 3.x and set `allow_writeable_chroot=YES` to ignore this error


Testing
=======

The cookbook comes with some testing facilities allowing you to iterate quickly
on cookbook changes.

## Rake

You can execute the tests with [Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org). The `Rakefile`
provides the following tasks:

    $ rake -T
    rake chefspec    # Run ChefSpec examples
    rake foodcritic  # Run Foodcritic lint checks
    rake knife       # Run knife cookbook test
    rake test        # Run all tests

## Bundler

If you prefer to let [Bundler](http://gembundler.com) install all required gems
(you should), run the tests this way:

    $ bundle install
    $ bundle exec rake test

## Berkshelf

[Berkshelf](http://berkshelf.com) is used to set up the cookbook and its
dependencies (as defined in `Berksfile`) prior to testing with Rake and Vagrant.

## Vagrant

With [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com), you can spin up a virtual machine and run
your cookbook inside it via Chef Solo.

This command will boot and provision the VM as specified in the `Vagrantfile`:

    $ bundle exec vagrant up <name>

Name refers to any box setup by `test-kitchen`, see below.

(Berkshelf's Vagrant plugin will make your cookbook and its dependencies
automatically available to Vagrant when creating or provisioning a VM.)

## Kitchen

This cookbook is using [test-kitchen](https://github.com/opscode/test-kitchen)  to propagate the `Vagrantfile`. You
can review the boxes by using:

    $ bundle exec kitchen list

Each item in this list is a regular vagrant box that can be started as
usual.

To run the full kitchen suite included in this cookbook simply execute:

    $ bundle exec kitchen test
